## Installation

### Automatic

Install the theme at [Dark Docs on UserStyles.world](https://userstyles.world/style/2597/dark-docs). Doing this will make it easy to receive updates. 

If [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/) is installed on your browser,\

### Manual 

1. Use a browser extension that applies user CSS themes to webpages, such as [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/).
2. Use the Less preprocessor on all the stylesheets, or enable it in UserCSS. 
3. Apply the stylesheets: 
    - [Colors and animations](colors-animations.css) to URLs starting with `https://docs.google.com/document/d/`, `https://docs.google.com/document/u/`, `https://docs.google.com/sharing/driveshare`, `https://docs.google.com/sharing/boq/driveshare`, `https://docs.google.com/picker/v2/home?req=%5B%22ireq%22%2C%5Bnull%2C%5B%5B1%5D%2C%5B%5D%2C%5B%5D%2C%5B%5D%2C%5B2048%2C2048%5D%5D%2C%5B1%5D%2Cnull%2Cnull%2C%5`, and `https://docs.google.com/picker/v2/home?req=%5B%22ireq%22%2C%5Bnull%2C%5B%5B1%2C6%5D%2C%5B%5D%2C%5B%5D%2C%5B%5D%2C%5B2048%2C2048%5D%5D%2C%5B1%5D%2Cnull%2Cnull%2C%5B`
    - [Basic elements](basic-elements.css) to `https://docs.google.com/document/d/`, `https://docs.google.com/sharing/driveshare`, and `https://docs.google.com/document/u/`
    - [Homepage](homepage.css) to `https://docs.google.com/document/u/`
    - [Main editor](main-editor.css), [side panels](side-panels.css), and [other screens](other-screens.css) to `https://docs.google.com/document/d/`
    - [Share sheet](share-sheet.css) to `https://docs.google.com/sharing/boq/driveshare`. This stylesheet is **incomplete**. 
    - [Google Images picker](google-images-picker.css) to `https://docs.google.com/picker/v2/home?req=%5B%22ireq%22%2C%5Bnull%2C%5B%5B1%5D%2C%5B%5D%2C%5B%5D%2C%5B%5D%2C%5B2048%2C2048%5D%5D%2C%5B1%5D%2Cnull%2Cnull%2C%5`. If this doesnâ€™t work for you, then you will need to look in dev tools and see where the iframe comes from. 
    - [Google Drive sidebar](google-drive-sidebar.css) to `https://docs.google.com/picker/v2/home?req=%5B%22ireq%22%2C%5Bnull%2C%5B%5B1%2C6%5D%2C%5B%5D%2C%5B%5D%2C%5B%5D%2C%5B2048%2C2048%5D%5D%2C%5B1%5D%2Cnull%2Cnull%2C%5B`. Like the Google Images picker, this side panel is an iframe so your link might be different. 

Dark Docs only works with Google Docs. There are plans to make themes for Google Sheets and Slides in the far future. If you create such a project (with a similar intent to this project), you may submit a pull request to include a link to it here.

## Contributing
The intent is simple - to make a dark mode for Google Docs web that shares the same colors and overall look to the Google Docs mobile app in dark mode. Check the [Design Guide wiki](https://github.com/winghongchan/dark-docs/wiki/Design-Guide) for guidance on using the color variables.
