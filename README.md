# Dark Docs `next`
A dark theme for Google Docs web, based on the colors used in dark modes in other Google products. Subtle animations added.\
`next` is my testing ground for using newer CSS and [{less}](https://lesscss.org/) preprocessor features. It is not currently published to userstyles.world. 

You can view the source code or install with Stylus at https://github.com/winghongchan/dark-docs/raw/next/dark-docs-next.user.css

## Normal version

[Dark Docs at UserStyles.world](https://userstyles.world/style/2597/dark-docs). 

Dark Docs only works with Google Docs. There are plans to make themes for Google Sheets and Slides in the far, far future. If you create such a project (with a similar intent to this project), you may submit a pull request to include a link to it here.

## Contributing
The intent is simple - to make a dark mode for Google Docs web that shares the same colors and overall look to the Google Docs mobile app in dark mode. It will stay in Material 2 unless Google devs decide to paint Google Docs with Material 3.
